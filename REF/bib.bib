  abstract = {Metadynamics is an atomistic simulation technique that allows, within the same framework, accelerating rare events and estimating the free energy of complex molecular systems. The key idea at its basis is modifying iteratively the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs). These Gaussians iteratively ``fill'' the free energy landscape as a function of the CVs, forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The potentiality of this idea is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants of the original approach that were developed during the years. The first scope of this review is presenting a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The efficaciousness of metadynamics, as well as that of the numerous alternative methods that enhance the sampling by biasing selected CVs, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs: if an important variable is forgotten, the approach does not provide a reliable estimate of the free energy, and can predict qualitatively wrong transition mechanisms. The second scope of this review is discussing how the CVs should be selected, how one can verify if the CVs that are chosen are sufficient or redundant, and how one can iteratively improve the CVs using machine-learning approaches.},

  abstract = {How a receptor transmits a signal                              G protein{\textendash}coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit diverse external signals into the cell. When activated by an outside stimulus, they bind to a G protein inside the cell and accelerate exchange of a bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) nucleotide for guanosine triphosphate, which initiates intercellular signaling. Dror                et al.                used atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations to show how GPCRs enhance GDP release. The G protein is dynamic and frequently adopts a conformation that exposes GDP even without the receptor bound. GPCR binding to this conformation favors an additional structural rearrangement that favors GDP release. The authors confirmed these predictions experimentally using double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy.

Here we use atomic-level simulations to elucidate the nucleotide-release mechanism. We find that the G protein {$\alpha$} subunit Ras and helical domains{\textemdash}previously observed to separate widely upon receptor binding to expose the nucleotide-binding site{\textemdash}separate spontaneously and frequently even in the absence of a receptor. Domain separation is necessary but not sufficient for rapid nucleotide release. Rather, receptors catalyze nucleotide release by favoring an internal structural rearrangement of the Ras domain that weakens its nucleotide affinity. We use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and protein engineering to confirm predictions of our computationally determined mechanism.},

  abstract = {Membrane receptors couple signaling pathways using various mechanisms. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest class of membrane proteins involved in signal transduction across the biological membranes. They are essential targets for cell signaling and are of great commercial interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Recent advances made in molecular biology and computational chemistry offer a range of simulation and multiscale modeling tools for the definition and analysis of protein{\textendash}ligand, protein{\textendash}protein, and protein{\textendash}membrane interactions. The development of new techniques on statistical methods and free energy simulations help to predict novel optimal ligands, G protein specificity and oligomerization. The identification of the ligand-binding activation mechanisms and atomistic determinants as well as the interactions of intracellular binding partners that bind to GPCR targets in different coupling states will provide greater safety in human life. In this review, recent approaches and applications of multiscale simulations on GPCRs were highlighted.}

  abstract = {Enhanced sampling algorithms have emerged as powerful methods to extend the utility of molecular dynamics simulations and allow the sampling of larger portions of the configuration space of complex systems in a given amount of simulation time. This review aims to present the unifying principles of and differences between many of the computational methods currently used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. In fact, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical and physical concepts. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine features of a relatively small number of the same enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them. This living review is intended to be updated to continue to reflect the wealth of sampling methods as they continue to emerge in the literature.},

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

  abstract = {The chemokine receptor CCR5 is known to exist in cell surface subpopulations that differ in their capacity to engage ligands. One proposed explanation for this phenomenon is the presence of CCR5 species with different levels of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Tyrosine sulfation and O-glycan sialylation are PTMs that add negative charges to the extracellular domain of CCR5 and make strong contributions to chemokine binding but it is not known whether cellular mechanisms to control their levels exist. In this study we used a combination of sulfation-sensitive and sulfation-insensitive CCR5 ligands to show that the rate of turnover of CCR5 tyrosine sulfation is more rapid than the rate of turnover of the receptor itself. This suggests that the steady state level of CCR5 sulfation is maintained through the combination of tyrosine protein sulfotransferase (TPST), the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-resident `source enzyme, and a `sink' activity that removes tyrosine sulfation from CCR5. By measuring the effects on ligand binding of knockdown and overexpression experiments, we provided evidence that non-lysosomal cellular arylsulfatases, particularly ARSG, ARSI and ARSJ, are CCR5 sulfation `sink' enzymes. We also used targeted knockdown and sialylation-sensitive and insensitive chemokines to identify the sialidase NEU3 as a candidate `sink' enzyme for CCR5 O-glycan sialylation. This study provides the first experimental evidence of activity of sulfatase and sialidase `sink' enzymes on CCR5, providing a potential mechanism for cells to control steady-state levels of these PTMs and thereby exert dynamic control over receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface and during receptor desensitization.},

Unfortunately, explicit structural information about hydrogen positions and thus H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes is extremely rare and similarly the important role of water during binding remains poorly understood. Here, we report on neutron structures of trypsin determined at very high resolutions {$\leq$}1.5\,{\AA} in uncomplexed and inhibited state complemented by X-ray and thermodynamic data and computer simulations. Our structures show the precise geometry of H-bonds between protein and the inhibitors                N                -amidinopiperidine and benzamidine along with the dynamics of the residual solvation pattern. Prior to binding, the ligand-free binding pocket is occupied by water molecules characterized by a paucity of H-bonds and high mobility resulting in an imperfect hydration of the critical residue Asp189. This phenomenon likely constitutes a key factor fueling ligand binding via water displacement and helps improving our current view on water influencing protein{\textendash}ligand recognition.},

  abstract = {Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is a key step in many signaling cascades. However, a complete mechanism for this process, which requires allosteric communication between binding sites that are {\textasciitilde}30 {\AA} apart, remains elusive. We construct an atomically detailed model of G protein activation by combining three powerful computational methods: metadynamics, Markov state models (MSMs), and CARDS analysis of correlated motions. We uncover a mechanism that is consistent with a wide variety of structural and biochemical data. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step for GDP release correlates with tilting rather than translation of the GPCR-binding helix 5. {$\beta$}-Strands 1 {\textendash} 3 and helix 1 emerge as hubs in the allosteric network that links conformational changes in the GPCR-binding site to disordering of the distal nucleotide-binding site and consequent GDP release. Our approach and insights provide foundations for understanding disease-implicated G protein mutants, illuminating slow events in allosteric networks, and examining unbinding processes with slow off-rates.},
